def get_min_of_three_members(x, y, z):
    # finish the function by adding code that would return the minimum of x, y and z
    # Use another function to find the minimum of y and z
    # Do not use the builtin min()
    pass


def reverse_string(string):
    # Add code that would return reversed string
    # Do not use slice notation or reverse()
    pass


# For the next functions, it is up to you to determine the names they should have
# 3. Write a function that would return if given int is within a certain range
# 4. Write a Python function to create and print a list where the values are square of numbers
# between 1 and 30 (both included)
# **5. Write a function that accepts multidimensional list and prints out list elements nested by
# their dimension:
# Example: [[1, 2, [3, 4, [6]]], [[], [], [3, 4, 5]]]
# 1, 2
#      3, 4
#          6
#
#
#          3, 4, 5
#
# Hint: You may, or you may not use recursion


# Decorators
# 1. Write a decorator that would be used on a function that return a number. If today is wednesday,
# friday, or sunday, the function should return the number decreased byt 1.5.
# 2. Write decorator login_required that would be used to check if a user is logged, and if not,
# it should print out "Login required", and if user is logged, the decorated function should print
# "Welcome"
# For user you can use {'name': 'User name', 'logged': True / False}
# 3. Write a decorator that prints out "Mary Spring" whenever the decorated function is called.


# Generator & decorator ***
# Define looking_glass context manager that should print out text reversed
# version while Context manager is acctive

# with looking_glass():
#     print('Pesho, Gosho, Mincho')
# Output: ohcniM ,ohsoG ,ohseP

print("Pesho, Gosho, Mincho")  # Should print out 'Pesho, Gosho, Mincho'
